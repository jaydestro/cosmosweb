# Azure Cosmos DB Developer Website

Site is hosted at https://developer.azurecosmosdb.com 

Content updates can be made against the `vs` branch. Once merged, changes will auto-deploy to the live site.

If you are working on bigger changes, setup a feature branch and we can create a staging slot to review/verify the rendered site.
